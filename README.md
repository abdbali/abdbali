<h5 align="left">During the first century of Turkey's venture into space, I was there with my profession and my radio during disasters. I actively operate on the VHF/UHF bands in the 2-meter and 70-cm ranges. My rooftop antenna and 25-watt in-car setup keep me connected. I listen and record on the SSB band. I participate in contests and events on the bands I'm active on. Lately, I've been interested in POTA and team-building efforts. 73!</h5>
