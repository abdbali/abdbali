# Amateur Radio Experiments for Space (TC3ATA)

During the first century of Turkey's venture into space, I was there with my profession and my radio during disasters. As an amateur radio operator, I actively operate on the VHF/UHF bands in the 2-meter and 70-cm ranges. My rooftop antenna and 25-watt in-car setup keep me connected, ensuring that I'm always ready for communication.

I engage in listening and recording on the SSB (Single Sideband) band, and I'm actively involved in contests and events on the bands where I'm active. Recently, my focus has shifted towards POTA (Parks on the Air) and team-building efforts to encourage more involvement in amateur radio.

## Key Activities:
- Operating on VHF/UHF frequencies (2-meter and 70-cm bands)

## Goals:
- Strengthen community involvement in amateur radio
- Promote team-based amateur radio activities
- Share knowledge and experiences related to radio communication in space and beyond
